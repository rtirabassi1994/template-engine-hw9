  ## Descriptiom
  This homework focuses on what we learned in class about object orientated programming. The application had to pass a test that was already provided.

  After I passed the test, I focused on creating the application. The app is designed for a manager to fill out a set questions about their team so they can easily access information. I created classes for the manager, employee, and intern. I used Inquirer NPM package to set up the interface.

  The user had to fill out questions regarding information about the manager, information about one engineer or intern, and add additional information about specfic employee.
